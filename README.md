# Customer Banking

## Overview

This script provides a simple interface for managing a customer's banking information, specifically for Savings and CD (Certificate of Deposit) accounts. It prompts the user for account details, calculates the interest earned, and displays the updated account balances.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Files

- `customer_banking.py`: Main script that interacts with the user and manages the Savings and CD accounts.
- `savings_account.py`: Contains the function `create_savings_account` to calculate the interest and updated balance for a savings account.
- `cd_account.py`: Contains the function `create_cd_account` to calculate the interest and updated balance for a CD account.
- `Accounts.py`: Contains the class for both balance and interest.

## References
Class material were referenced to build this solution. My instructor Metin also reviewed the savings account file with me during office hours. Chat GPT helped create the readme file.

## Commic Relief
Any and all errors were a direct contribution from myself. 

## Error Handeling
This script currently lacks error handling, but it may be added in a future update based on user feedback. 

### Running the Script

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
python customer_banking.py
